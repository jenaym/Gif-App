# Gif-App

- When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.
- Users can add additional buttons to the page.
- When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.
- Under every gif, its rating (PG, G, so on) and a favorite button is displayed
